# Flax Project

The flax project consists of three sub-projects:

- [BAM Consensus](consensus_bam): creating a .bam assembly from .fasta scaffold sequences
- [BAM Combination](combined_bam): combining the .bam files of several genotypes together
- [Gapped BAM](gapped_bam): finding the corresponding reference geonome sequences to gaps in a .bam file
